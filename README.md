## Building

This project uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to generate the needed HTML, CSS, and JS files. For example, `index.html` is generated by combining the HTML files inside `src/html_components/`, and the main `script.js` is generated by combining and minifying all of the JavaScript files inside `src/js/`.

To build the calculator on your machine, you will need a working installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node.js installed, clone the repository locally and install the required Node.js modules (the following steps are for Linux/macOS):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/illustra/gwa.git
cd gwa
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```

You are now ready to make your changes to the files inside `src/`. When you're done, build the calculator:

```bash
gulp all
```

Open the resulting `index.html` with your favorite browser.

## Contributing

The calculator is automatically built with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) to make updating and testing easier. NPM dependencies are also automatically updated by [Greenkeeper.](https://greenkeeper.io)
