* Progressive web app **(can run offline on [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=serviceworkers))**

## Building

This project uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to generate the needed HTML, CSS, and JS files. For example, `index.html` is generated by combining the HTML files inside `src/html/`, and the main `script.js` is generated by combining and minifying all of the JavaScript files inside `src/js/`.

To build the calculator on your machine, you will need a working installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have Node.js installed, clone the repository locally and install the required Node.js modules (the following steps are for Linux/macOS):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/illustra/gwa.git
cd gwa
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```

You also need to download the JavaScript libraries used by the calculator:

```bash
mkdir -p dist/js
curl 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js' > dist/js/jquery.min.js
curl 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js' > dist/js/fastclick.min.js
curl 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.touchswipe/1.6.18/jquery.touchSwipe.min.js' > dist/js/touchswipe.min.js
curl 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.28/webfontloader.js' > dist/js/webfontloader.min.js
```

You are now ready to make your changes to the files inside `src/`. When you're done, build the calculator:

```bash
gulp all
```

Open the resulting `index.html` with your favorite browser.

## Contributing

The calculator is automatically built with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) to make updating and testing easier. If you have a suggestion for the calculator, you can either
